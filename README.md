# CSharp
A place where I store C# projects.

The stuff you'll find here ranges from complete and useable projects to small experiments. The whole thing is under the MIT licenese so you can do whatever you want with any of this code.

With that said, some of the stuff in here may not be very helpful (I get lots of random ideas) so do keep that in mind when looking through and checking things out.
